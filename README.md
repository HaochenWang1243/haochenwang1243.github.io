Welcome! I’m Haochen Wang, a learner and enthusiast in machine learning and signal processing.  
Here, I share short articles and thoughts on things that I find interesting in these areas.  
I’m still learning front-end web development with Jekyll, so while I finish setting up this site, you can visit the articles folder to read my posts (some written with some help from AI). The proper site will be up soon!
